Neplan(c) Soap
================================

This project can access Nepan 10 through SOAP requests.

Tested with Nepan 10.9.2.x on premise installation. It could also work with the cloud version of Neplan.
You need a valid Licence of Neplan also for the modules. There is no check of a valid licence or module.

Check out the project if you have not already done so (with git installed):
```sh
git clone git://github.com/Akira74/NeplanSOAP.git
cd NeplanSOAP
```
